# vsFTPD Server Installer For Debian

This script will let you setup your own FTP server in no more than a minute. It has been designed to be as universal as possible.

# Installation

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tankibaj/vsFTPD/master/vsFTPD.sh`

`bash vsFTPD.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users or uninstall vsFTPD.

`bash vsFTPD.sh`

#### Note: This shell should work on ubuntu as well. I haven't tried. Im not big fan of ubuntu
